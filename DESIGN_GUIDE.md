# Deriv's Got Talent Design System & Rulebook

## 1. Visual Identity
- **Concept**: "The Grand Stage" - A talent show for trading logic.
- **Aesthetic**: Toy-like, colorful, tactile, and playful. Think "Duolingo meets Robinhood".
- **Corners**: Large radius (20px+) for a friendly, soft feel.
- **Elevation**: Use "3D/Toy" shadows. Instead of soft blur, use a solid offset shadow (2-4px down) to make elements look like physical blocks.

## 2. Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deriv Coral (#FF444F) - Branding, primary buttons, "Going Live".
- **Success/Entry**: Mint Green (#4BB543) - Positive results, entry blocks.
- **Warning/Sizing**: Amber Gold (#FFB000) - Caution, position sizing.
- **Danger/Exit**: Bright Rose (#FF5252) - Stop loss, exit blocks.
- **Utility**: Sky Blue (#3498DB) - General tools.
- **Judge Accents**:
    - Rita: Soft Lavender (#A29BFE)
    - Yang: Electric Blue (#0984E3)
    - Sharpe: Sage Green (#55E6C1)
- **Backgrounds**: 
    - Card: #FFFFFF (Pure White)
    - Canvas: #F0F2F5 (Soft Grey-Blue)
- **Text**: 
    - Primary: #2D3436 (Deep Charcoal)
    - Secondary: #636E72 (Muted Slate)

## 3. Typography
- **Headlines**: Rounded, Bold Sans-Serif (e.g., system-default rounded or bold sans). No Monospace for headings.
- **Body**: Clean Sans-Serif.
- **Editorial Style**: Large, expressive headers. Use Title Case.
- **No Screaming Caps**: Never use ALL CAPS for general labels. Use Sentence Case or Title Case.

## 4. Voice & Tone
- **Coach Persona**: The app is your mentor/coach. "You're doing great!", "Ready for the big stage?", "Let's refine this routine."
- **Friendly Terminology**:
    - Strategy -> Routine
    - Deploy -> Go Live / Performance
    - Analyst -> Judge
    - Telemetry -> Performance Stats
    - Battle/Arena -> The Stage

## 5. UI Components
- **Blocks**: Must look like physical puzzle pieces. Use thick bottom borders to simulate 3D depth.
- **Buttons**: Bouncy (scale on press). Solid colors with darker bottom borders.
- **Charts**: Smooth, organic lines. Friendly tooltips.
- **Empty States**: Use cute illustrations or friendly messages.
